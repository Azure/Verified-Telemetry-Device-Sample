# Troubleshooting for the Azure RTOS getting started guide

As you follow the individual tutorials in the series [Getting Started with Azure RTOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2129824), you might experience some common issues. In general, issues can occur in any of the following sources:

* **Your environment**. Your machine, software, or network setup and connection.
* **Your Azure IoT resources**. The IoT hub and device that you created to connect to Azure IoT.
* **Your device**. The physical board and its configuration.

This troubleshooting guide provides suggested resolutions for the most common issues that can occur as you complete the tutorials.

## Prerequisites

All the troubleshooting steps require that you've completed the following prerequisites for the tutorial you're working in:

* You installed or acquired all prerequisites, and additional software tools, for the specific tutorial in the series [Getting Started with Azure RTOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2129824).
* You created an Azure Iot hub, and registered a device, as directed in the tutorial.
* You built an image for the device, as directed in the tutorial.

## Issue: The source directory does not contain CMakeLists.txt file
### Description
This issue can occur when you attempt to build the project. It is the result of the project being incorrectly cloned from GitHub. The project contains multiple submodules that will not be cloned by default unless the **--recursive** flag is used.

### Resolution
* When you clone the repository using Git, confirm that the **--recursive** option is present.

## Issue: Device can't connect to Iot hub

### Description

The issue can occur after you've created Azure resources, and flashed your device. When you try to connect your newly flashed device to Azure IoT, you see a console message like the following:

* *Unable to resolve DNS for MQTT Server*

### Resolution

* Check the spelling and case of the configuration values you entered for your IoT configuration in the file *azure_config.h*. The values for some IoT resource attributes, such as `deviceID` and `primaryKey`, are case sensitive.

## Issue:  Wi-Fi is unable to connect

### Description

After you flash a device that uses a Wi-Fi connection and try to connect to your Wi-Fi network, you get an error message that Wi-Fi is unable to connect.

### Resolution

* Check your Wi-Fi network frequency and settings. The devices used in the getting started guide all use 2.4 GHz. Confirm that your Wi-Fi router is configured to support a 2.4 GHz network.
* Check the Wi-Fi mode. Confirm what setting you used for the WIFI_MODE constant in the *azure_config.h* file. Check your Wi-Fi network security or authentication settings to confirm that the Wi-Fi security mode matches what you have in the configuration file.

## Issue: Flashing the board fails

### Description

You can't complete the process of flashing your device. You will know this if you experience any of the following symptoms:

* The **.bin* image file that you built does not copy to the device.
* The utility that you're using to flash the device gives a warning or error.
* The utility that you're using to flash the device does not say that programming completed successfully.

### Resolution

* Try using a different Micro USB cable. Some devices and cables are incompatible.
* Try connecting to a different USB port on your computer. A USB port might be disconnected internally, disabled in software, or temporarily in an unusable state.
* Restart your computer.

## Issue: Device fails to connect to port

### Description

After you flash your device and connect it to your computer, you get a message like the following in your terminal software:

```
Failed to initialize the port.
Please verify the COM port settings.
```

### Resolution

* In the settings for your terminal software, check the **Port** setting to confirm that the correct port is selected. If there are multiple ports displayed, you can open Windows Device Manager and select the **Ports** node to find the correct port for your connected device.

## Issue: Terminal output shows garbled text

### Description

After you flash your device successfully and connect it to your computer, you see garbled text output in your terminal software.

### Resolution

* In the settings for your terminal software, confirm that the **Baud rate** setting is *115,200*.

## Issue: Terminal output shows no text

### Description

After you flash your device successfully and connect it to your computer, you see no output in your terminal software.

### Resolution

* Confirm that the settings in your terminal software match the settings in the tutorial.
* Restart your terminal software.
* Press the **Reset** button on your device.
* Confirm that your USB cable is properly connected.

## Issue: Communication between device and IoT Hub fails

### Description

After you flash your device and connect it to your computer, you get a repeated messages like the following in your terminal window:

```
Failed to publish temperature
```

### Resolution

* Confirm that the *Pricing and scale tier* is one of *Free* or *Standard*. **Basic is not supported** as it doesn't support cloud-to-device and device twin communication.

## Next steps

If you reviewed all the previous issues, and you still cannot monitor your device in a terminal or connect to Azure IoT, there might be an issue with your device's hardware or physical configuration. See the manufacturer's page for your device to find documentation and support options.
